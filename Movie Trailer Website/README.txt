Make sure you have Python installed correctly and your folder includes three python modules:
- fresh_tomatoes_lisa.py
- movie.py
- my_movies.py

Now, just run my_movies.py (e.g. by double-clicking)!

If you click on the poster images of the movies, you can watch the official trailer. 
Additionally, you get some extra information about the movie in a tooltip when mouseover.
